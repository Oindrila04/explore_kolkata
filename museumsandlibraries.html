				<br><p class="text-small1">Greater Kolkata has more than 30 museums, which cover a wide variety of fields and India's largest library.</p>

			<p class="sectionTag">National Library of India</p>
			<p class="sectionSubTag1"> The National Library of India is India's largest library by volume and public record. The library is designated to collect, disseminate and preserve printed material produced within India. With a collection in excess of 2.2 million books and records, it is the largest in the country. Before independence, it was the official residence of Governor-General of India.</p>
			
			<p class="sectionSubTag1">The National Library is a result of the merging of the public library with the Imperial Library—several government libraries. The National Library (1953), then the Imperial Library housed several foreign (British) and Indian titles and was open to the public. It collects book, periodicals, and titles in virtually all the Indian languages while the special collections in the National Library of India house at least fifteen languages. The Hindi department has books that date back all the way to the nineteenth century and the first ever books printed in that language. The collections break down and consist of 86,000 maps and 3,200 manuscripts.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="sectionSubTag1">In 2010, the Ministry of Culture, the owner of the library, decided to get the library building restored by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). While taking stock of the library building, the conservation engineers discovered a previously unknown room, the secret ground-floor room, about 1000 sq. ft. in size which seems to have no opening of any kind. The ASI archaeologists tried to search the ceiling of the room for a trap door, but found nothing. Since the building is of historical and cultural importance, ASI has decided to bore a hole through the wall instead of breaking it. There are speculations about the room being a punishment room used by Warren Hastings and other British officials, or a place to store treasure. In 2011, the researchers announced that the room was filled entirely with mud, probably in an effort to stabilize the building</p>
