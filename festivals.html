				<p class="text-small1"> Kolkata is the cultural capital of India. There’s a saying in Bengali that goes, baro mashe tero parbon, literally ‘13 festivals in 12 months’, neatly summing up the importance — and yearlong abundance — of festivals in Kolkata’s everyday life. From cultural extravaganzas to some of India's biggest Hindu festivals, there's always something going on in the city. </p>
				
				<br><p class="text-small1">The entire atmosphere is painted completely different during the festivals and there is a lot of commotion and rush all around. </p>

			<p class="sectionTag">Durga Puja</p>
			<p class="sectionSubTag1">Durga Puja, held in September–October, is the biggest and most important festival of West Bengal as well as of Kolkata. It marks the victory of ten-armed goddess Durga over the buffalo demon Mahishasur and signifies the victory of good over evil.Some 3000 pandals are erected throughout Kolkata and its suburbs. Pujas are also conducted in sizeable number of family households. </p>
			<br>
			<p class="sectionSubTag1"> Although the root of Durga Puja is essentially religious, the festival has slowly changed into more of a social carnival than a religious festival, where people from other religious or ethnic backgrounds freely participate in the festivity. It has become Kolkata's biggest public spectacle, glamorous art event and consumerist carnival. The city is decked up with lighting decorations. Loudspeakers play popular songs as well as recitation of mantras by priests. Shops, restaurants and eateries stay open all night. Fairs are set up in numerous parks and public spaces. The roads become overcrowded with hundreds of thousands of devotees, revellers and pandal-hoppers visiting the pandals on Puja days.</p>
			<br>		
			<p class="sectionSubTag1">On Bijaya Dashami, the day of the festival, people bid adieu to goddess Durga offering her sweets and sindoor. Before bidding adieu to the goddess, the married women assemble near the idol, apply vermilion on her feet or forehead and then smear vermillion on each other. This is a part of the last celebration before the idols are taken out in grand processions of song, dance, music and then immersed in the waters. The idol immersion ceremony continues for the next few days. People distribute sweets and visit their friends, family members and relatives to exchange the Bijoya greetings.</p>
