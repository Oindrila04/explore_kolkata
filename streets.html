			<p class="sectionTag">Howrah Bridge</p>
			<p class="sectionSubTag">The Howrah Bridge is a balanced cantilever bridge over the Hooghly River. The bridge is one of four on the Hooghly River and is a famous symbol of Kolkata and West Bengal.  It weathers the storms of the Bay of Bengal region, carrying a daily traffic of approximately 100,000 vehicles and possibly more than 150,000 pedestrians, easily making it the busiest cantilever bridge in the world. The third-longest cantilever bridge at the time of its construction, the Howrah Bridge is currently the sixth-longest bridge of its type in the world. </p>
			<br>
			<p class="sectionSubTag"> The longitudinal expansion and lateral sway movement of the deck are taken care of by expansion and articulation joints. There are two main expansion joints, one at each interface between the suspended span and the cantilever arms and there are others at the towers and at the interface of the steel and concrete structures at both approach. There are total 8 articulation joints, 3 at each of the cantilever arms and 1 each in the suspended portion. These joints divide the bridge into segments with vertical pin connection between them to facilitate rotational movements of the deck. The bridge deck has longitudinal ruling gradient of 1 in 40 from either end, joined by a vertical curve of radius 4,000 feet. The cross gradient of deck is 1 in 48 between kerbs.</p>

			<p class="sectionSubTag">College Street, the paradise for every bookworm derives its name from the presence of many colleges (Presidency University, The Sanskrit College and University, City College of Commerce & Business Administration to name a few). The road houses many centres of intellectual activity especially the Indian Coffee House, a café that has attracted the city's intelligentsia for decades. </p><br>
			<p class="sectionSubTag"> Kolkata’s historic College Street is India’s largest book market, lending it the endearing nickname Boi Para. </p>
			<br>
			<p class="sectionSubTag">The College Street is most famous for its small and big book stores, which gives it the nickname Boi Para (Colony of Books). People from the whole city and different parts of the state gathers here for their books. Many bigwigs of the Bengali publication industry (like: Ananda Publishers, Mitra and Ghosh Publishers, DasGupta and Company Pvt. Ltd, Dey's Publishing, Rupa & Co., Asha Book Agency etc.) are situated here. The street is also dotted with countless very small book kiosks which sell new and old books.

			<p class="sectionTag">Vidyasagar Setu</p>
			<p class="sectionSubTag"> Vidyasagar Setu, also known as the Second Hooghly Bridge, is a toll bridge over the Hooghly River in linking the cities of Kolkata and Howrah. It is the first and longest cable-stayed bridge in India .</p>
			<br>
			<p class="sectionSubTag">The deck is made of composite steel-reinforced concrete with two carriageways. The two side spans are supported by parallel wire cables and has a capacity to handle more than 85,000 vehicles in a day.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="sectionSubTag">The design of the bridge differs slightly from other bridges, which are of live load composite construction. The difference is in the dead load design concept adopted for this bridge and concreting of the side spans done with support provided by the intermediate trestle. The deck is designed with a grid structure of girders. One set of girders are at the end and another set in the middle, which are braced by girders spaced centre to centre.</p>

			<p class="sectionSubTag">Park Street, officially known as Mother Teresa Sarani, is a famous thoroughfare in the city of Kolkata.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="sectionSubTag">Park Street has been the main evening recreation zone for Kolkata people since the British era. In the 1970s and 1980s much of Kolkata's night life took place in Park Street, with many clubs and restaurants situated there. Many noted musicians had played at various popular night spots, such as Trinca's, Peter Cat, Oly Pub, Blue Fox, Mocambo and Moulin Rouge. Even before that, from the 1940s through to the late 1960s, Kolkata's prolific night life was centred on fashionable Park Street.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="sectionSubTag">Park Street remains Kolkata's foremost dining district, with many restaurants and pubs. It is often known as "Food Street" and "The Street that Never Sleeps". It is still one of the prime commercial and entertainment zones of the city. Park Street is traditionally decorated with lights on Diwali, Christmas Day and New Year's Eve.</p>
