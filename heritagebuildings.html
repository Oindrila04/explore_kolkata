			<p class="sectionTag">Calcutta High Court</p>
			<p class="sectionSubTag">The Calcutta High Court is the oldest High Court in India. The court has a sanctioned judge strength of 72. The structure was designed by Walter Long Bozzi Granville.The bill to rename it as Kolkata High Court was approved by the Union Cabinet on 5 July 2016 along with the renaming of its two other counterparts in Chennai and Mumbai.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="sectionSubTag">The neo-Gothic High Court building was constructed in 1872, ten years after the establishment of the court itself. The design, by then government architect Walter Granville, was loosely modelled on the 13th-century Cloth Hall at Ypres, Belgium. In 1977 another building named High Court Centenary Building or annexed building was inaugurated to reduce the pressure.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="sectionSubTag">As per the Calcutta High Court (Extension of Jurisdiction) Act, 1953, the Calcutta High Court's jurisdiction was extended to cover Chandernagore (now called Chandannagar) and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands as of 2 May 1950. The Calcutta High Court extended its Circuit Bench in Port Blair, the capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and in Jalpaiguri, the divisional headquarters of the North Bengal region. On 7 February 2019, President Ram Nath Kovind finalised the opening of the other circuit bench in Jalpaiguri, West Bengal with the jurisdiction area within 5 districts- Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar and Cooch Behar.</p>

			<p class="sectionTag">Raj Bhavan</p>
			<p class="sectionSubTag">Raj Bhavan is the official residence of the Governor of West Bengal, located in Kolkata, the capital of the Indian state of West Bengal built in 1803. After the transfer of power from the East India Company to the British Crown in 1858, it became the official residence of the Viceroy of India, moving here from the Belvedere Estate. With the shifting of the British Indian capital from then Calcutta to Delhi in 1911, it became the official residence of Lieutenant Governor of Bengal. Since independence in 1947 it serves as the official residence of the Governor of West Bengal and came to be known as the Raj Bhavan, a name it shares with the official residences of other states' governors.</p><br>
			<p class="sectionSubTag"> The architecture comprises a central core with four radiating wings. The state rooms located in the central core are accessed from the outside by a flight of grand steps on the north. On the south is another portico surmounted by a colonnaded verandah with a dome above. The four wings accommodate the various offices and residential quarters along with four sets of staircases.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="sectionSubTag">The Raj Bhavan has six gateways, one each on the north and south and two each on the east and west. The four gates on the east and west have grand archways topped with lions, while the minor archways on the side are topped with sphinxes.</p>

			<p class="sectionTag">Writers' Building</p>
			<p class="sectionSubTag">Writers' Building is the secretariat building of the Government of West Bengal. The giant pediment at the centre is crowned with the statue of Minerva. The terrace also contains four clusters of statues christened Justice, Commerce, Science and Agriculture. It is an edifice of the great political significance and memories of the Indian Independence movement. </p>
			<br>
			<p class="sectionSubTag">It originally served as the principal administrative office for writers (junior clerks) of the British East India Company(EIC). Designed by Thomas Lyon in 1777, the Writers' Building has gone through a long series of extensions over the centuries. Since India's independence in 1947, it housed the office of the Chief Minister of West Bengal, cabinet ministers and other senior officials, until 4 October 2013, when a major restoration of the building was announced. The majority of government departments were subsequently moved out to a new repurposed building named Nabanna in Howrah on a temporary basis.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="sectionSubTag">The building has been called a mini-township of sorts with a built-up area of around 550,000 square feet. Before the shifting of the state secretariat, the building housed 34 departments of the state government, and served as the office for approximately 6,000 employees.</p>

			<p class="sectionTag">The Oberoi Grand</p>
			<p class="sectionSubTag">The Grand Hotel, now called the Oberoi Grand, is situated in the heart of Kolkata on Chowringhee Road. It is an elegant building of British era and is a famous building in Kolkata. The hotel got a major lift during World War II when about 4000 soldiers were billeted there, and would party regularly.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="sectionSubTag">The site where the hotel now stands was first developed at No. 13 Chowringhee Road as the private residence of a Colonel Grand in the early nineteenth century. Built in an extravagant neoclassical style, the hotel soon became a popular spot amongst the English population of Calcutta. It was known, in particular, for its annual New Year party that, along with iced champagne and expensive gifts, involved the release of twelve piglets in the ballroom. Anyone who caught a piglet, could keep it.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="sectionSubTag">The hotel features a large white building covering an entire block, colonnaded verandahs and balconies on the upper floors, projecting portico for the entire length of the block supported on paired columns with Ionic capitals, and stucco ornamentation in the facade.</p>
