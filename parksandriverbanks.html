Local farmers and fisher folk use water hyacinth to create a buffer between land and water to minimise erosion. The area is also home to large numbers of coconut and betel nut trees. Many varieties of vegetables are farmed here, including cauliflower, eggplant, pumpkin, sunflower and sacred basil. Tracts of land are dedicated to paddy cultivation as well.</p>
